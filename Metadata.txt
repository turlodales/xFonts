Description:

Fontcase is an app that lets you install custom fonts on iOS and iPadOS.

1) Import fonts from your iCloud Drive or Dropbox and add them to your collection of favorites.

2) Tap on any listed font and you'll get a preview of the characters along with other metadata.

3) When you're done collecting, install your fonts in Settings and they'll be available in other apps, including iWork, to make your documents look better than ever.

Fontcase is completely open source, so your privacy is ensured. The app only adds fonts to your settings and does not modify them at all in the process. For more information on why this is important, see the app's Help tab.

Enjoy!
